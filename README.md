Problem 1.Create a model to predict next 3 day stock prices using historical data. 
Creating a model to predict stock prices involves several steps, and there are many different approaches you can take. One common approach is to use machine learning techniques, particularly regression algorithms. Here's a simplified example using Python and the scikit-learn library:
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Load historical stock data
historical_data = pd.read_csv('historical_stock_data.csv')  # Assuming you have a CSV file with historical stock data

# Feature engineering
# Here, you would typically engineer features such as moving averages, technical indicators, etc.
# For simplicity, let's assume we only have one feature which is the closing price

# Define features and target variable
X = historical_data[['Close']].values
y = historical_data['Close'].shift(-3).values  # Target variable shifted by 3 days to predict next 3 days stock prices

# Split data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
print('Mean Squared Error:', mse)

# Predict next 3 day stock prices
# Use the most recent closing price as input for prediction
last_close_price = X[-1]
next_3_day_predictions = model.predict(last_close_price.reshape(1, -1))
print('Predicted next 3 day stock prices:', next_3_day_predictions)
In this example:

We load historical stock data from a CSV file.
We engineer features, which could include various technical indicators or transformations of the raw data.
We split the data into training and testing sets.
We train a simple linear regression model using the closing prices as the feature and the closing prices shifted by 3 days as the target variable.
We make predictions on the test set and evaluate the model's performance using mean squared error.
Finally, we predict the next 3 day stock prices using the trained model.



Problem 2.Sentiment analysis on the news/twitter related to a particular stock.
Sentiment analysis on news or Twitter data related to a particular stock involves extracting textual data from news articles or tweets and analyzing the sentiment expressed in that text. Here's a simplified example using Python and the TextBlob library for sentiment analysis:
import tweepy
from textblob import TextBlob

# Authenticate to Twitter
consumer_key = 'YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY'
consumer_secret = 'YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET'
access_token = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'
access_token_secret = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET'

auth = tweepy.OAuth1UserHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token, access_token_secret)
api = tweepy.API(auth)

# Function to fetch tweets
def get_tweets(stock_symbol, count=100):
    tweets = api.search(q=stock_symbol, count=count)
    return [tweet.text for tweet in tweets]

# Function to perform sentiment analysis
def analyze_sentiment(text):
    analysis = TextBlob(text)
    if analysis.sentiment.polarity > 0:
        return 'Positive'
    elif analysis.sentiment.polarity == 0:
        return 'Neutral'
    else:
        return 'Negative'

# Get tweets related to a particular stock
stock_symbol = 'AAPL'  # Example stock symbol (Apple)
tweets = get_tweets(stock_symbol, count=100)

# Analyze sentiment of each tweet
sentiments = [analyze_sentiment(tweet) for tweet in tweets]

# Count the number of positive, neutral, and negative sentiments
positive_count = sentiments.count('Positive')
neutral_count = sentiments.count('Neutral')
negative_count = sentiments.count('Negative')

# Print results
print(f"Sentiment Analysis for {stock_symbol}:")
print(f"Positive: {positive_count} tweets")
print(f"Neutral: {neutral_count} tweets")
print(f"Negative: {negative_count} tweets")
In this example:

We authenticate to the Twitter API using OAuth credentials.
We define functions to fetch tweets related to a particular stock symbol and perform sentiment analysis on the fetched tweets.
We specify a stock symbol (e.g., 'AAPL' for Apple) and fetch a specified number of tweets related to that stock.
We analyze the sentiment of each tweet using TextBlob, a library for processing textual data.
We count the number of positive, neutral, and negative sentiments expressed in the tweets.
Finally, we print the results of sentiment analysis.


Problem 3.. Compare two or more companies based on their industry
Comparing companies based on their industry involves analyzing various aspects such as financial performance, market share, growth prospects, competitive positioning, and more. Here's a general framework to compare two or more companies within the same industry:

Problem 4. Search engine to make use of information retrieval techniques for searching. 
Creating a search engine that makes use of information retrieval techniques involves several steps. Here's a simplified outline of how you could build one:

Data Collection: Gather the data that will be searchable. This could be web pages, documents, articles, etc. You may use web scraping techniques to collect data from websites or import existing datasets.

Preprocessing:

Tokenization: Break down the text into individual words or tokens.
Normalization: Convert words to lowercase, remove punctuation, and handle special cases like stemming (reducing words to their root form) or lemmatization (reducing words to their dictionary form).
Stopword Removal: Eliminate common words like "and", "the", "is", etc., which do not contribute much to the meaning of the text.
Indexing:

Inverted Index: Build an inverted index that maps each word/token to the documents (or locations within documents) where it appears. This allows for efficient retrieval of documents containing specific words.
Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF): Calculate TF-IDF scores for each term-document pair, which helps in ranking the relevance of documents to a given query.
Query Processing:

Parsing: Parse user queries to identify search terms and any additional parameters (e.g., Boolean operators, phrase queries).
Ranking: Use retrieval models (e.g., vector space model, BM25) to rank documents based on their relevance to the query.
Search Algorithm:

Implement an algorithm to retrieve relevant documents based on the user query and the index built earlier.
Support various types of queries, including simple keyword searches, Boolean queries, phrase queries, and more complex queries.
User Interface:

Develop a user interface (UI) where users can input their queries and view the search results.
Design the UI to display relevant information about each search result (e.g., title, snippet, source) and provide options for refining or filtering the results.
Scalability and Performance:

Optimize the search engine for scalability and performance, especially if dealing with large volumes of data.
Consider techniques like distributed indexing, caching, and query optimization to improve efficiency.
Evaluation:

Evaluate the search engine's performance using standard metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
Collect user feedback to identify areas for improvement and refine the search algorithms accordingly.
Deployment:

Deploy the search engine to a web server or hosting platform, making it accessible to users over the internet.
Popular tools and libraries for building search engines include Elasticsearch, Apache Solr, and Whoosh (Python library). These tools provide many features out-of-the-box and can significantly streamline the development process. However, building a search engine from scratch provides a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts and allows for more customization.
